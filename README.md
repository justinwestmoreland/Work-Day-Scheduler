# Work-Day-Scheduler
This project was a ground up build of a workday scheduler. 

My normal workday runs from about 6am to 6pm so I wanted it to be versitile and practical to use for those who work outside regular 9-5 jobs. 

I used Bootstrap CSS to create the framework and the three columns of time of day, tasks to be completed, and a save button. 

When time has elapsed, the save button disappears and the text for the time of day and tasks is turned light grey. Additionally, you are unable to add text to the task as the text areas are disabled. 

During the current time, the styling is slightly changed to show the row in green. 

All future times have the default styling and are colored blue. 

Don't worry if you accidentally navigate away from the page or refresh, all tasks are saved in your browswers local memory so you are able to come back and access before the end of the day!

I hope you enjoy your new organized work day!
